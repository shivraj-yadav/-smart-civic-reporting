# 🏙️ Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution System

A web-based platform that enables citizens to report civic issues (potholes, garbage overflow, water leakage, etc.) and allows municipal authorities to manage and resolve them efficiently through automated worker assignment.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Citizens lack a centralized, transparent system to report civic problems. Complaints are manually assigned, leading to delays, duplicate efforts, and no accountability in resolution.

---

## 💡 Solution

This system automates the entire lifecycle of civic complaints — from reporting to resolution:

- Citizens report issues with **photo, description, and auto-captured GPS location**
- System **automatically assigns** the complaint to the **nearest worker** within a 5km service radius
- Workers resolve issues and upload **completion proof**
- Citizens receive **real-time status updates** throughout the process
